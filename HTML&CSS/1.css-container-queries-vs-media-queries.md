# CSS Container Queries vs. Media Queries

In modern frontend development, CSS Container Queries and Media Queries both handle responsiveness, but they target responsiveness differently.

## 1. Media Queries
Media queries adjust styling based on characteristics of the entire viewport (e.g., screen width, height, resolution).


```
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .card {
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```
- **Scope:** Applies based on the entire viewport size.

- **Use case:** When responsive design should depend on the browser window size or device screen.

## 2. Container Queries
Container queries apply styles based on the characteristics (usually width) of a specific container rather than the viewport.

```
.container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (max-width: 500px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```
- **Scope:** Applies based on parent element dimensions.

- **Use case:** When you want responsive styling that depends on the size of a componentâ€™s parent, making components reusable and adaptable regardless of where they are placed.

| Aspect                     | Media Queries                                             | Container Queries                                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Basis for Query**        | Viewport dimensions                                       | Container (parent) element dimensions                              |
| **Reusability**            | Less reusable (tied to viewport)                          | Highly reusable (adapts within different layouts)                  |
| **Component Independence** | Dependent on global viewport size                         | Independent from global viewport, responds only to local container |
| **Maintainability**        | Can require multiple adjustments for different components | Easier to maintain components that adapt to various containers     |
